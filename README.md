# Active Learning for Medical Image Annotation
## 📘 Project Overview

This project aims to build a **high-quality, fully labeled dataset of torso CT scans** through an **active learning pipeline** that reduces manual annotation effort while improving segmentation performance.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

**PyTorch, 3D Slicer, SimpleITK, NumPy, Matplotlib**

## 🚀 Key Contributions

•**Developed a 2D Bayesian UNet** for medical image segmentation of torso CT scans.

•**Implemented an active learning workflow using Monte Carlo Dropout** to automatically identify low-uncertainty cases for annotation, optimizing dataset expansion speed and quality.

•**Scaled the labeled dataset** from 5 to 20 cases efficiently, improving segmentation coverage across **19 muscle groups and fat regions** (subcutaneous and visceral).

•**Collaborated with radiologists and medical researchers** to validate and refine annotations for clinical reliability.

•**Created a publication-quality ground truth dataset**, supporting reproducible research in musculoskeletal imaging.
