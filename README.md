# Active Learning for Medical Image Annotation
## Project Overview

-This project aims to build a **high-quality, fully labeled dataset of torso CT scans** through an **active learning pipeline** that reduces manual annotation effort while improving segmentation performance.

## Technologies & Tools

**PyTorch, 3D Slicer, SimpleITK, NumPy, Matplotlib**

## Key Contributions

-**Developed a 2D Bayesian UNet** for medical image segmentation of torso CT scans.

-**Implemented an active learning workflow using Monte Carlo Dropout** to automatically identify low-uncertainty cases for annotation, optimizing dataset expansion speed and quality.

-**Scaled the labeled dataset** from 5 to 20 cases efficiently, improving segmentation coverage across **19 muscle groups and fat regions** (subcutaneous and visceral).

-**Collaborated with radiologists and medical researchers** to validate and refine annotations for clinical reliability.

-**Created a publication-quality ground truth dataset**, supporting reproducible research in musculoskeletal imaging.

## What I Learned

-Deep understanding of **uncertainty-based active learning** for medical imaging.
